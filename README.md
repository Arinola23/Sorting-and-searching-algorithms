# Insertion Sort in JavaScript

## Overview

This repository contains a simple JavaScript implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. Insertion Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly building a sorted sequence from the elements of an array.

## Algorithm Description

Insertion Sort is similar to how we sort playing cards in our hands. It considers one element at a time, picking it up and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/insertion-sort-js.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd insertion-sort-js
    ```

3. Run the JavaScript file:

    ```bash
    node insertionSort.js
    ```

4. View the sorted result in the console.

## Example

```javascript
// Example usage:
let cards = [5, 7, 4, 6, 2, 3];
insertionSort(cards);
console.log("Sorted cards:", cards);
